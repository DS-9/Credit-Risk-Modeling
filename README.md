This project focuses on credit risk modeling using machine learning techniques. The key technologies and accomplishments are:  
        
## Technologies:    
1. Python programming language
2. Data manipulation and analysis libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
3. Machine learning libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
4. Interactive data visualization: Plotly
              
## Accomplishments:
1. Performed data cleaning and feature engineering on a credit risk dataset to prepare it for modeling.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and visualize the relationships between features and loan status.
3. Encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.
4. Implemented and evaluated several supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting loan status, including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
    - Support Vector Classifier
    - XGBoost Classifier
5. Optimized the Support Vector Classifier using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
6. Compared the performance of different models using evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
7. Identified Logistic Regression as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 82.11% for predicting loan approval.

The project showcases the end-to-end process of building a credit risk prediction model, including data preparation, EDA, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. It leverages popular Python data science and machine learning libraries to achieve its objectives.
